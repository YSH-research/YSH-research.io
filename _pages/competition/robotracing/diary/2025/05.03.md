## 📝 What We Did

Using two distinct ERP platforms, we designed multiple driving scenarios and conducted simulations based on these setups within a ROS 2 environment. The resulting data was collected in the form of ros2 bag files, which will be used for training and evaluating perception and control algorithms in autonomous driving systems.
